Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software Engineering is the systematic application of engineering principles, methods and tools to the development and maintenance of high quality software systems.
Importance: Enables the creation of software applications and systems that power various aspects of modern life such as communication, e-commerce, entertainment etc.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
The development of programming languages e.g C
Establishment of Software engineering as a discipline in 1960.
Advent of structured programming and the rise of agile methodologies.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
Requirements - gathering and documenting users needs and system requirements
Design - creating high level and detailed designs of the software architecture and user interface.
Implementation - writing code and building the software according to design specifications.
Testing - conducting tests to ensure the software meets quality standards and functional requirements.
Deployment - realising the software to users or customers.
Maintenance - providing ongoing support, updates and enhancements to the software after deployment.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Waterfall - sequential approach with distinct flowing downwards like a waterfall
Ideal for projects with clearly defined requirements, minimal expected changes, and a need for strict adherence to a structured plan.
Agile - iterative and incremental approach focused on flexibility, collaboration and responding to change.
Appropriate for projects with evolving requirements, a need for frequent customer feedback, and adaptability to changing circumstances.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
Software developer - respnsible for writing code & implementing software sokutions.
Quality Assurance Engineer - ensures software quality by designing and executing test plans
Project manager - oversees the planning, execution and delivery of software projects.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
IDEs - software suites that provide comprehensive tools for writing, debugging and testing code e.g., Visual Studio.
VCS - software tools for tracking changes to source code and coordinating work among team members e.g., Git.

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
Challenges: Changing requirements, Tight deadlines, Technical debt
Strategies to overcome challenges: effective communication, agile methodologies, regular reassessment of project goals and timelines, prioritization of tasks.

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
Unit - testing individual components or module of software
Integration - testing interactions between different components or subsytems
System - testing the entire software system as a whole
Acceptance - testing the software against user requirements to ensure it meets users needs

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt Engineering - crafting questions or statements to get the best response from AI models
Importance: helps make questions clear and specific so that AI understands exactly what is needed

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective. 
Vague prompt: Tell me about software
Improved prompt: Tell me about software engineering
It helps the AI model to understand that you are looking for information about software engineering rather than the general area software
